##Potentiostat


To assemble the potentiostat, first you should send to manufacture the PCB, in our case we sent it to JLPCB (https://jlcpcb.com/), and buy the components listed on the Bill of Materials file. After that, you should solder those materials on the PCB. You can also request them to solder the components, if they have them.
To be able to plug the electrode, we welded three pins into it.

Any team could reproduce this potentiostat sending the gerber and the NC Drill files to the manufacturer.

Regarding to the case, we designed it with a 3D modelling software, and we cut the flat faces in methacrylate with a laser cutter machine and otherwise we printed it with a 3D printer.

The PCB was made with the Altium Designer software. Altium can export PCB and schematic files as ACCEL-ASCII files. With these files you can import them to Eagle.


## Fluorimeter
To assemble the fluorimeter, you should send to manufacture the PCB, for instance we sent it to JLPCB (https://jlcpcb.com/) and buy the components listed on the Bill of Materials file. After that, you should solder those materials on the PCB. You can also request them to solder the components, if they have them.

In relation to the case, we designed it with a 3D modelling software, and we cut the faces in methacrylate with a laser cutter machine.

## Wax Module

To assemble the Wax Module, you should send to manufacture the PCB, in our instance we sent it to JLPCB (https://jlcpcb.com/) and buy the components listed on the Bill of Materials file. After that, you should solder those materials on the PCB. You can also request them to solder the components, if they have them.

Any team could reproduce this module sending the gerber and the NC Drill files to the manufacturer.


The PCB was made with the Eagle software. To generate the necessary files, you can follow the JLPCB guide (https://support.jlcpcb.com/article/43-how-to-export-eagle-pcb-to-gerber-files).

In relation to the case, we designed it with a 3D modelling software, and we cut the faces with a laser cutter and the part where the resistances are located, was printed with an aluminium printer. Also, the part where the stamps are placed can be printed with a 3D printer.
The first design was made with PLA, however it got too hot and we melted it, thus the next design was made in aluminium, additionally it is a better conductor of heat. 


##PCR, Thermal Modules


To assemble the NinjaPCR, you can make it yourself following the instructions written on their webpage or buy it (https://ninjapcr.tori.st/en/index.html). 
To automatize the lid you just have to print the Engine_Support 3D model and buy the DS3225 25Kg servomotor.

The PCB of the Thermal Module is assembled in the same way as the potentiostat.
The other option is buying it from their webpage.

In relation to the case, we redesigned the NinjaPCR case with a 3D modelling software, and we cut the faces with a laser cutter in methacrylate and in wood. We had to redesign the case because the fan we used was too big in comparition to the one the NinjaPCR uses.
At the beginnig we bougth the ARCTIC Freezer 11 LP fan, but it did not dissipate enough heat and the peltier cell started getting hot, therefore we changed it to SilverStone SST-AR06. With this one was enough, but at some point it broke down and we finally changed it to ARCTIC F12 - 120 mm.


##Shaker Module

The PCB of the Shaker Module is assembled in the same way as the potentiostat. Like the Wax Module, most of the components were soldered by the manufacturer.

The PCB was made with the Eagle software. To generate the necessary files, you can follow the JLPCB guide (https://support.jlcpcb.com/article/43-how-to-export-eagle-pcb-to-gerber-files).

In relation to the case, we designed it with a 3D modelling software, and we printed the module with a 3D printer.
