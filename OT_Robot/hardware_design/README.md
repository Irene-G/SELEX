# Hardware Design

## Potentiostat

To assemble the potentiostat, first you should send to manufacture the PCB, in our instance we sent it to JLPCB (https://jlcpcb.com/) and buy the components listed on the Bill of Materials file. After that, you should solder those materials on the PCB. You can also request them to solder the components, if they have them.

Any team could reproduce this potentiostat sending the gerber and the NC Drill files to the manufacturer.

Regarding to the case, we designed it with a 3D modelling software, and we cut the flat faces in methacrylate with a laser cutter machine and otherwise we printed it with a 3D printer.

The PCB was made with the Altium Designer software. Altium can export PCB and schematic files as ACCEL-ASCII files. With these files you can import them to Eagle.

## Fluorimeter
To assemble the fluorimeter, you should send to manufacture the PCB, for instance we sent it to JLPCB (https://jlcpcb.com/) and buy the components listed on the Bill of Materials file. After that, you should solder those materials on the PCB. You can also request them to solder the components, if they have them.

In relation to the case, we designed it with a 3D modelling software, and we cut the faces in methacrylate with a laser cutter machine.

## Wax Module
Wax Module
To assemble the Wax Module, you should send to manufacture the PCB, in our instance we sent it to JLPCB (https://jlcpcb.com/) and buy the components listed on the Bill of Materials file. After that, you should solder those materials on the PCB. You can also request them to solder the components, if they have them.

Any team could reproduce this module sending the gerber and the NC Drill files to the manufacturer.

The PCB was made with the Eagle software. To generate the necessary files, you can follow the JLPCB guide (https://support.jlcpcb.com/article/43-how-to-export-eagle-pcb-to-gerber-files).

In relation to the case, we designed it with a 3D modelling software, and we cut the faces with a laser cutter and the part where the resistances are located, was printed with an aluminium printer. Also, the part where the stamps are placed can be printed with a 3D printer.

## PCR, Thermal Modules
To assemble the NinjaPCR, you can make it yourself following the instructions written on their webpage or buy it (https://ninjapcr.tori.st/en/index.html).

To assemble the Thermal Module, you can send to manufacture the PCB, in our instance we sent it to JLPCB (https://jlcpcb.com/) and buy the components listed on the Bill of Materials file. After that, you should solder those materials on the PCB. You can also request them to solder the components, if they have them. The other option you could buy it from their webpage.

In relation to the case, we redesigned the NinjaPCR case with a 3D modelling software, and we cut the faces with a laser cutter in methacrylate and in wood. 

We redesigned it because we used another fan.

## Shaker Module
To assemble the Shaker Module, you should send to manufacture the PCB, in our instance we sent it to JLPCB (https://jlcpcb.com/) and buy the components listed on the Bill of Materials file. After that, you should solder those materials on the PCB. You can also request them to solder the components, if they have them.
