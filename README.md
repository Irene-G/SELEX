# SELEX (Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) Protocol
Biotechnological protocol for obtaining trained libraries of aptamer molecules automated with the Opentrons OT-2 robot.
This protocol is a part of our contribution to the 2019 iGEM international biotechnology competition. More information can be found in our

_The robot and SELEX process_

The small-sized thermal cycler is controlled via motherboard Ninja-PCR Arduino-alike, as shown below, manually welded, whose code is in NinjaPCR [folder](https://github.com/Zildj1an/SELEX/tree/master/NinjaPCR). You can update a new binary since ESP8266 SystemOnChip includes the TCP/IP stack.
