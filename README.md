This is the biotechnological protocol for obtaining trained libraries of aptamer molecules automated with the Opentrons OT-2 robot. This protocol is a part of our contribution to the 2019 iGEM international biotechnology competition. For the thermocycler we built the Ninja-PCR. More information about the entire project can be found in our <a href = "https://2019.igem.org/Team:MADRID_UCM/Landing">website</a>. The small-sized thermal cycler is controlled via motherboard Ninja-PCR Arduino-alike, as shown above, manually welded, whose code is in NinjaPCR [folder](https://github.com/Zildj1an/SELEX/tree/master/NinjaPCR). You can update a new binary since ESP8266 SystemOnChip includes the TCP/IP stack.

## The SELEX Process
Aptamers are a cutting-edge technology that is revolutionizing biotechnology, from biosensing to synthetic biology.Aptamers are single-strand DNA molecules that hold nature’s most important information: our genetic code.But instead of using DNA for carrying information, our aptamers depend on DNA’s 3-dimensional shape. We genetically engineer this shape to take hold of and mesh with our target molecule.DNA’s unique role in nature gives aptamers amazing characteristics, making them robust, stable, and cheap to produce.
